# FSI Server Integration Guide for AI coding assistatns

This guide explains how to collaborate with the FSI server through the fsi-server mcp server.

## MCP-Based FSI Session Integration

Agents send over commands through MCP and can look at fsi outputs through MCP.
The user can also directly input statements in the fsi.exe console.
The agent can follow along with what the user enters and the results from those statements through the MCP endpoints.

## Workflow for F# Code Execution

When executing F# code, follow this MCP-based workflow:

### 1. When working together on an fsx script, add the code to Collaborative Script **FIRST**
**CRITICAL WORKFLOW**: ALWAYS add code to the .fsx file FIRST using the Edit tool, THEN send to FSI over mcp.
This maintains the collaborative script as the authoritative source of truth.

**NEVER** develop substantial code only in FSI - the .fsx file is our collaborative workspace and must stay current.

### 2. Send Code to FSI via MCP for type-checking and evaluation

### 3. Read FSI Response
After processing, check the response through MCP

### 4. Validate Execution
**CRITICAL**: After sending code to FSI, ALWAYS check the fsi output through the MCP server. If there are compilation errors, runtime errors, or any failures, ALERT the user immediately with "ALERT: We have a problem!" and describe the specific error, then start working on a fix. NEVER report work as "successful" or "complete" if there are any errors in the response.

### 5. FSI State Management - CRITICAL
**FSI maintains persistent state between subsequent evaluations**. This creates potential inconsistencies between your .fsx file and the running FSI session.

**FSI Session Restart**: For major changes or when debug code pollutes the session and is causing aliasing/shadowing issues:
- Tell user: "Please restart your FSI session to clear all old function definitions"
- Then reload the complete .fsx file content over mcp

## Example Execution Pattern

```bash
# 1. Add to collaborative script (WITHOUT ;; and WITHOUT attribution comments)
Edit scratch.fsx to append: let result = 42 * 2

# 2. Execute in FSI via MCP
Content: "let result = 42 * 2;;"

# 3. Read response using MCP

# 4. Work as a silent English-to-F# interpreter - the user sees all results in their FSI session window.
```

## Key Principles

- **MCP-Based Protocol**
- **Dual Actions**: Always both save to script file first AND then send to FSI over MCP
- **No Attribution**: Don't mark code as "Added by Agent" - we collaborate seamlessly as two pair programmers.
- **Monitor Responses**: Check responses over mcp for FSI output and errors
- **Preserve Context**: The fsx file maintains our collaborative session state
- **FSI State Consistency**: Always ensure FSI session state matches .fsx file content - suspect stale state when unexpected behavior occurs
- **Silent Collaboration**: NEVER explain calculations or provide step-by-step breakdowns. Execute F# code silently. Do not report results - the user can see them in their FSI window. Only provide explanations if explicitly asked.
- **No Result Echoing**: Do not echo or report FSI results back to the user. They can see the output in their own FSI session. Work as a completely silent partner.
- **Exception for Open-Ended Questions**: When the user asks open-ended questions, requests advice, or asks for explanations, respond normally with full communication. The silent mode only applies to F# code execution tasks.
